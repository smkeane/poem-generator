# Poem Generator

This generator uses a corpus of language data to write poems. It chooses words based on their part of speech, syllable count, and rhyme as well as their probability of being adjacent to one another. This generator was created as part of a group project for a course in computational linguistics, and the syllable and rhyme functionality were created by my two group members. I recently updated the generator so the user can customize the number and genre of poems created. Enjoy!

## Getting Started

This program is in Python and runs in a jupyter notebook (I've been editing and testing it in Colaboratory)

### Prerequisites

The program will have the user import a corpus from NLTK the first time it is run.
